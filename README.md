# Map_Navigation_DSA_Project

IIT Jodhpur Campus Navigator (Graph + Linked Lists)

This is a console-based Campus Navigation System that models the IIT Jodhpur campus as a weighted graph using linked list–based adjacency lists.

The program helps users explore campus routes, find the shortest paths between locations, and understand how graph algorithms like BFS and Dijkstra’s Algorithm work in practice.


Features

-> View complete campus map (adjacency list view)

-> Find shortest path (by number of turns / hops — BFS)

-> Find shortest route (by minimum distance — Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

-> Interactive menu-driven console interface

-> Robust input handling and error checking


Graph Representation

Nodes: Campus locations (Hostels, LHCs, Departments, Messes, etc.)

Edges: Roads connecting two locations

Weights: Distances between connected nodes

Implementation: Linked List–based Adjacency List


Algorithms Used

->BFS (Breadth-First Search) - Finds shortest path in terms of number of turns (edges) - Unweighted shortest path

->Dijkstra’s Algorithm - Finds shortest route based on distance - Weighted shortest path

Concepts Demonstrated
->Graph representation using linked lists
->Use of STL containers (map, queue, priority_queue)
->Path reconstruction using parent maps
->Menu-driven program design
->Input validation and exception handling
